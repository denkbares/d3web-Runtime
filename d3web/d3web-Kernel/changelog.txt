	QuestionOC: new method "detectMultipleFiring" detects, if there are active
		rules, that want to set different values to the QuestionOC; then,
		an error-message will be written
	CaseFactory: fixed a bug
	QContainerIterator: the order of the followQuestions in the List returned
		by "createFollowList" is now exactly the same as the order that is
		defined by the "children1"-relation in D3Lisp
	MQDialogController: many changes ...
	

build_3_15
	2003_02_07 georg 17:40
	modified the behavior of MQDialogController and created a new Method in
	D3WebCase ("createAnsweredXPSCase"). It creates a new case and answers
	all indicated questions (in an order defined by a given dialogcontroller)
	with the help of a dialog-proxy. 
	(minor modifications also in DialogController and OQDialogController)

build_3_14
	2003-01-31 georg & joba 14:00
	Modifications:
	CondDState: CondDState.eval() now throws a NoAnswerException if no rule has fired
		on the diagnosis
	RuleComplex: now, if a NoAnswerException occurs in RuleComplex.canFire() while 
		evaluating the diagnosis-context, the rule cannot fire
	QuestionOC: the method "getNumericalSchemaValue(..)" is now public 
		(necessary only, to explain OC-Questions that have a schema)

build_3_13
	2003-01-23 norman 14:25
	I modified the undo and refire-Mechanism in RuleComplex.check(). 
	It does now only behave that way, if an elementary value
	in a questionSetter-action has changed, so that a formula needs to be recalculated.
	This change fixes a stack overflow in cyclic rules. 
	Do also have a look at the comment in RuleComplex.check()

build_3_12
    2002-12-20 joba 18:11
    Merry X-Mas,
    Patched RuleAdd/SetAction, so that self-cyclic rules 
    (rule contains question in condition and action) do not create
    non-terminating recursion. 


build_3_11
    2002-12-16 joba 21:12
    Handling of Num2ChoiceSchema added:
    A Num2ChoiceSchema is a knowledge slice of QuestionOC, which 
    facilitates the question to receive numerical values (AnswerNum)
    and to convert it to an appropriate choice answer.

build_2002_12_11_2
	2002-12-11 cbb 16:15
	removed schema. Removed Evaluatable by pulling up FormulaExpression.
	Moved FormulaExpression to formula-Package, removing evaluatable-Package.
	

build_2002_12_11

	2002-04-15	Chris	15:00

0.2 build 153 joba & marty (2002-03-07)
	  Added equals(Object) and hashCode methods for classes IDObject (checks for equal IDs)
	     and NamedObject (checks for equal IDs and Texts).
	  Removed equals method in QuestionChoice (simply checked for equal reference).

0.2 build 151 Chris & Norman (25.02.2002)
	  MMInfoContainer Interface now with getId(). Therefore AnswerNum and AnswerText needed a getId()-method.
	  AnswerNum always returns <questionId>+"aNum".
	  AnswerText always returns <questionId>+"aText".
	  
0.2 build 150 norman
	  removed calls of deprecated method XPSCase::getDialogController()	

0.2 build 149 norman
	 OQDialogController::addUserIndicationQASet(QASet) is public again.

0.2 build 148 chris (22.02.2002)
	  some more changes in OQDialogController.checkUnblocked to make it more readable.

0.2 build 147 chris && norman (22.02.2002)
	  changes in findPreviousUnblockedOnHistory

0.2 build 145 Chris (21.02.2002)
	  Refactoring the 'Reason'ing-Mechanism for QASets. Now pro and cons are stored as QASet.Reason-Objects.
	  These objects wrap a rule and its belonging problem-solving method, if the reason is a rule.
	  In case of being an InitQASet or one activated by the user, the rule is null and only the ProblemSolvingMethod
	  is used.

0.2 build 144 Chris (21.02.2002)
	  Refactoring of TQASetManager-Interface (see 0.2 build 142).
	  Centralized three different add methods to one propagate-Method.

0.2 build 143 Andreas (21.02.02)
	  changed CondNum.setValue(double) to public because
	  of ruleEditor in KnowME

0.2 build 142 Chris (21.02.2002)
	  Splitted DialogController: Case now only should see QASetManager.
	  This is not implemented totally correct right now, since it the DialogControllers need to be refactored
	  in order to reflect the change.

0.2 build 141 Chris (21.02.2002)
	  Splitted ActionNextQASet into three types of actions in order to represent
	  refining-, clarifying- and general indication-rules. Some dialog Controllers might want to
	  use this special information to determine the order of QASets.

	  Attention: because I did not change the dialog controller, this will not affect anything - so I did not
	  write new tests for this.
	  
	  When writing a dialog controller, make sure to test proper behaviour when recieving the new Actions...

0.2 build 140 norman (g�r�me) (19.02.2002)
	  Added Interface "KnowledgeContainer", so that KnowledgeBase can add KnowledgeSlices
	  Implementors: NamedObject, KnowledgeBase

0.2 build 138 Chris (11.02.2002)
	  Refactoring of the dialog controlling mechanism: a dialog controller can be set via its class
	  rather than via a String.

0.2 build 137 Chris (11.02.2002)
	  Fixed a small problem with missing packages.

0.2 build 135 Chris (30.01.2002)

0.2 build 129 tim (25.01.2002)
	  Class QuestionNum:
	  - added MethodsetDynamicAlternatives
	  Class QuestionYN:
	  - changed identifier for fields yes,no protected->public

0.2 build 128 Chris+Tim (25.01.2002)
	  Changed some identifiers (protected->public) and added QuestionNum.getDynamicAlternatives.
	  Both is needed for editing the decision tree.

0.2 build 127 Chris (22.01.2002)
	  Fixed the problem with heuristic N7 rules:
	  The dominate all other values, so I set it to NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
	  Undoing such rules have to recompute the values. I prefered the simplest way - taking all the rules which fired and adding up their values.

0.2 build 126 joba (14.01.2002)
	  Added Class de.d3web.kernel.domainModel.ruleCondition.CondNumIn 
	  Moved Field CondNumEqual.EPSILON to Class CondNum

0.2 build 122 Chris (11.01.2002)
	  Refactoring of MMInfoStorage: new Interface MMInfoContainer for QASet (instead of Question), Diagnosis and Answer);
	  New Class MMInfoObject, which bundles DescriptorObject and Content.
	  MMInfoStorage.add... takes a MMInfoObject.
	  MMInfoStorage now properly handles retrieval. See test for behaviour. (>= d3web Tests 0.2 build 62)

0.2 build 121 Chris (11.01.2002)
	  integrated a missing change of 119 into 120, resulting in 121.

	  PSMethod::isContributingToResult indicates whether a problemsolver
	  both is able to and should contribute to the result of a case.
	  This interface is used for XPSCase::getDiagnoses(DiagnosisState).

0.2 build 116   Chris (04.01.2002)
	  PSMethodUserSelected became a singleton.

0.2 build 115 + 114   Chris (04.01.2002)
	  Added PSMethodCombination, PSMethodDialogControlling and PSMethodUserSelected
      to allow user suggestion/establishing of diagnosis including effects on dialog order.
	  Combination uses maximum state according to the following order:
      null < UNCLEAR < EXCLUDED < SUGGESTED < ESTABLISHED

0.2 build 113 (norman)
	  dialog-proxy is not singleton any more. Client access now possible by priority

	  toString() of Invalid..QasetException corrected.

0.2 build 101.3 (norman)
	  moveToPreviousQASet() in OQDialogcontroller sets the Value of currentQASet and

	APrioriyProbability is now spelled correct ;-)
0.2 build 60: Chris (8. June 2001, 13:30)
	Removed unneccessary System.out.calls
0.2 build 58+59: Chris (1. June 2001, 11.00)
    CondKnown returns false for "nein/sonstiges"
    
	For a=not known, b=4 the rule IF a=known OR b=known then c=a+b results in c=4!!
 	This is a misconception in my opinion, but it works that way in d3, so we should fake it!   
0.2 build 56: Chris (31. May 2001, 13:45)
	Fixed a bug in de.d3web.kernel.domainModel.formula.Count
	We had to treat unknown and no/misc: these alternatives result in a count of zero!

	Diagnosis.getScore(XPSCase) is now deprecated

0.2 build 32: norman (12. Mar. 2001, 14:03)
	Fixed some little bugs in the OQDialogController.
	Now 'XPSCase::isFinished()' and 'DialogController::moveToQuestion(..)'
	seem to work correctly...

0.2 build 31: norman (12. Mar. 2001, 13:30)
	Added ExceptionQuestion(Next/Previous).
	moveToNext(Newest)QASet returns an ExceptionQuestionNext if no next question exists.
	moveToPreviousQASet returns an ExceptionQuestionPrevious if the historyCursor was 0 
		(there is no previous Question).

	if getCurrentQASet() invoked after that, an Invalid(Next/Previous)QASetException will
	be thrown.

0.2 build XXX: joba (09. Mar. 2001. 10.43)
	Properties in NamedObject and PropertyDescriptor added
0.2 build 26+27: chris (08. Mar. 2001, 15:49)

0.2 build 24: norman (08. Mar. 2001, 10:55)
	Added package de.d3web.kernel.dialogControl.exceptions.
	It contains exceptions that will be thrown, if someone tries to
	access a nonexisting next/previous QASet.

0.2 build 23: norman (07. Mar. 2001, 16:46)
	Fixed bug: propagate in PSMethodQuestionSetter only checked RuleSymptoms.
			   checks now RuleComplexes. (neccessary e.g. for RuleAddValue...)

0.2 build 18: norman (03. Mar. 2001, 15:39)
	Added RuleAddValue to de.d3web.kernel.psMethods.questionSetter
	The test case is RuleAddValueTest in the test project.


0.2 build 15: norman (01. Mar. 2001, 16:34)
	Fixed followQuestion bug in OQDialogController
	(in getNextQASet: hasNextFollowingQuestion instead of getNextFollowingQuestion ;-) )
	=> added methods hasNextFollowingQuestion() and hasNextContraQuestion().


0.2 build 14: norman (01. Mar. 2001, 11:16)
	Added new factoryMethod to CaseFactory. 
	With this method it is possible to select the type of DialogController
	that will be used in the XPSCase.
	By using the old "createXPSCase" an OQDialogController will be instanciated by default.

	Further I put the MQDialogController and QContainerIterator into the de.d3web.dialogControl package.


0.2 build 12: norman (27. Feb. 2001, 17:10)
	Did some changes at the DialogController.

0.2 build 5: norman (20. Feb. 2001, 20:58)
	Added "add/getAnsweredQASet(), getCurrentQASet()" to DialogController
	New Class: 	QContainerIterator. With this Iterator it is possible to navigate
				through a QContainer (Questions and Follow-Questions)

0.2 build 4: norman (20. Feb. 2001, 15:50)
	Added method getPSMethodInstance(Class) to XPSCase
	Class Answer has now an MMInfoStorageS


0.2 build 1: chris (15. Feb. 2001, 09:17)
	The diagnosis-score-schema is -42, 10 (not 30), 42; according to FP. Fixed that.
	Comment: The original D3 schema contained another value "etwas-verdächtig",
	which worked exactly as "verdächtig" did. The limits for "etwas-verdächtig" were 10,30.
	The faulty schema resultet from this missing item. We still do not need this value,
    so the schema had to be corrected.
0.1 build 8: chris
	Implemented part of schema-functionality (in de.d3web.kernel.domainModel.formula)
	getUnknownAlternative should return an AnswerUnknown-Object.
	Implemented a complete parent-children-relation for named objects
